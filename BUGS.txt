* sound effects lag on vista 32 bit (ask jack casey) also on ubuntu (pulse audio?)
	(seems to be fixed on ubuntu by installing pulseaudio sdl drivers)

* clicking on a widget and then dragging the mouse out breaks button state - requires a FocusLeft() method of some kind.

* replace "e.key == [int]" with K_* instead

* remove instances of "from resource import *" and replace with actual imported resources

* occasionally tooltips barf in certain instances

* when fill painting outside the box (other operations too?):

AttributeError: BitLevel instance has no attribute 'id'

(using line tool, but happens quite often)

+ Bug when level background is being drawn upon but is offscreen:
	File "/home/chrism/dev/games/Infinite8BitPlatformer/engine/Tools.py", line 79, in PenDown
	self.savedImage, self.image_start, dummy = self.currentSurface.SubImage(pos, pos)
	AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'SubImage'
	(Appears to be a bug when the level is sending you changes but you've switched levels)

+ start game, press enter, opens browser (chat box focus needs fixing)

+ cwd command in the root script changes to the wrong directory if not called from library.zip

+ send current level edit id to the server when switching levels, and stop the server sending modifications we already have

+ on-screen messages are broken (appear late)

+ get tooltips to clamp to screen area again
