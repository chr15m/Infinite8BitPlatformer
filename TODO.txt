* BUG: Core.py 110 AttributeError: 'bool' object has no attribute 'id'

* BUG: drawing lines at the same time makes them go all funny (bad redraw)
* BUG: make all line tools hide themselves before any line tool applies itself - store order of application

* BUG: player dying bug is still happening when you join a level and the other player is updating

* BUG: Shannon's USB/bluetooth bug (manifests as gamepad/joystick bug)

* BUG: lockup/memory exhaustion when fill-painting again!

* BUG: level must be named before you can set it as a teleport dest (stored as ints server side)

* add inventory

* don't pick up things unless you are player or the pickup comes from the network

* some way to find other players (arrows pointing to them?)

* display some kind of indicator when someone is typing a message

* play a sound effect for chat

* show progress indicator on background paint

* menu with credits and website link

* do not play the teleport noise if a portal leads nowhere, and post a message

* custom avatar colour?

* implement server-unique player names (the following are john's ideas)
	* /find PlayerName - This would tell what level that player is on.
	* /join or /meet PlayerName - jump to the same level and platform the other player is on

* mouse over player lets you edit your name or shows other player's name

* a way to move the camera without moving the player around

* unknown command message for slash commands that we do not know

* new clients should appear on a random level with high popularity and not too many users already

* 'like' button lets you like a particular place on a particular level

* 'share' button lets you share a particular location on social media

* pixel collisions after bounding box collisions

* fix collision detection to take into account velocity of players as well as position

* Check out Julian's changes to game over animation

* make chat boxes/speech bubbles avoid eachother

* store items collected server side

* make clients accept the i8bp://levelname/portal and i8bp://levelname/x/y format to launch the game and teleport

* make background fill happen incrementally across frames
	* OR: use spinner?
	* OR: both?

* network server
	* check for data corruption in saved files - e.g. if a PenDown has no matching PenUp yet (someone was mid-draw when the level saved)
	* hold a lockfile when writing levels to disk
	* special server connection allows full admin access
	* WNF: keep a copy of the level server side and make local modifications to it
	* WNF: make level downloading work (md5sum, latest edit)
	* proper disconnect when finished command (accounts for channel buffer)
	+ make settings configurable

* customiseable level sizes

* network client
	* make PenMove message be self sufficient (includes start of line too)
	* use message 'when' timestamp to not show old messages
	* try to auto-reconnect if not connected, every 10 seconds
	* WNF: send level md5 and edit info to server and download differing levels

* chat box functionality
	* /new command (does the same as new button)
	* /quit command
	* /back command

* TextInput class (PodSix)
	* key repeat
	* copy/paste
	* up and down arrow should scroll through chat history
	+ fix arrow keys to move around in edit box (done - thanks julian!)

* improve dying - fade then zap to last platform
	* if there is no last platform, pick one from the level
	* if the level has no platforms, create one in the center of the level

* Make player not be white-on-white on light levels

* make notifications 'slots' based instead of counter based

* rollovers for edit buttons

* new prop type that you don't hit for 'foreground' stuff

* edit mode menu
	* new things
		+ platform
		+ portal
		+ item
	* edit things
		+ delete
		+ move
		+ clone
	* graphics things
		+ draw
		+ fill
		+ line
		> rectangle
	* palette button
		* choose color
		* select palette
	> other
		> undo

> zooming

* palettes and palette mapping code
