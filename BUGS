* props should stay within max level size
* using fill tool on the bounding box where item meet platforms
* crash when filling just outside a bounding box for an object
* default level background color = text color
	* cache rendered text graphics
* fill is too slow - game freezes if you do many fills quickly
* off-by-one graphics bug
* sound effects lag on vista 32 bit (ask jack casey)
	* tweak buffer sizes?
